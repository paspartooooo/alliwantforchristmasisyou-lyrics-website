        I don't want a lot for Christmas
    There is just one thing I need
    I don't care about the presents
    Underneath the Christmas tree

        I just want you for my own
    More than you could ever know
    Make my wish come true
    All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

        I don't want a lot for Christmas
    There is just one thing I need
    And I don't care about the presents
    Underneath the Christmas tree

        I don't need to hang my stocking
    There upon the fireplace
    Santa Claus won't make me happy
    With a toy on Christmas Day

        I just want you for my own
    More than you could ever know
    Make my wish come true
    All I want for Christmas is you
    You, baby

        Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
    I won't even wish for snow
    And I'm just gonna keep on waiting
    Underneath the mistletoe

        I won't make a list and send it
    To the North Pole for Saint Nick
    I won't even stay awake to
    Hear those magic reindeer click

        'Cause I just want you here tonight
    Holding on to me so tight
    What more can I do?
    Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
    You, baby

        Oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
    And the sound of children's laughter fills the air

        And everyone is singing
    I hear those sleigh bells ringing
    Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
    Won't you please bring my baby to me?

        Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
    This is all I'm asking for
    I just wanna see my baby
    Standing right outside my door

        Oh, I just want you for my own
    More than you could ever know
    Make my wish come true
    Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
    You, baby

        All I want for Christmas is you, baby [repeat with ad-libs until fade]
